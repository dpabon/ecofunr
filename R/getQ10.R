#' Function to determine the temperature sensitivity (\eqn{Q_{10}}{Q10} value) and time varying basal efflux (R$_b$) from a given temperature and efflux (usually respiration) time series.
#' Conventionally, the following model is used in the literature:
#'
#' \deqn{Resp(i) = R_b Q_{10}^\frac{T(i)-Tref}{\gamma}}{Resp(i) = R_b Q10^((T(i)-Tref)/gamma)},
#'
#' where \eqn{i}{i} is the time index. It has been shown, however, that this model is misleading when \eqn{R_b}{Rb} is varying over time which can be expected in many real world examples (e.g. Sampson et al. 2008).
#'
#' If \eqn{R_b}{Rb} varies slowly, i.e. with some low frequency then the 'scale dependent parameter estimation, SCAPE'
#' allows us to identify this oscillatory pattern. As a consequence, the estimation of $Q_{10}$ can be substantially stabilized (Mahecha et al. 2010). The model becomes
#'
#' \deqn{Resp(i) = R_b(i) Q_{10}^\frac{T(i)-Tref}{\gamma}}{Resp(i) = R_b(i)Q10^((T(i)-Tref)/gamma)},
#'
#' where \eqn{R_b(i)}{Rb(i)} is the time varying 'basal respiration', i.e. the respiration expected at \eqn{T_{ref}}{Tref}. The convenience function getQ10 allows to extract the \eqn{Q_{10}}{Q10} value minimizing the confounding factor of the time varying \eqn{R_b}{Rb}. Four different spectral methods can be used and compared. A surrogate technique (function by curtsey of Dr. Henning Rust, written in the context of Venema et al. 2006) is applied to propagate the uncertainty due to the decomposition.
#'
#' The user is strongly encouraged to use the function with caution, i.e. see critique by Graf et al. (2011).
