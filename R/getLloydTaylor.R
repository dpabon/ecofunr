#' Function to determine the activation energy (\eqn{Ea}{Ea} value) and time varying saturation efflux (\eqn{R_b}{Rb}) from a given temperature and efflux (usually respiration) time series.
#' The following model was proposed by .....:
#'
#'  \eqn{Resp(i) = R_b e^{\frac{1}{Tref-T0} - \frac{1}{T(i)-T0}}}{Resp(i) = Rb * exp(1/(Tref-T0) - 1/(T(i)-T0))},
#'
#' where \eqn{i}{i} is the time index. It has been shown, however, that this model is misleading when \eqn{R_b}{Rb} is varying over time which can be expected in many real world examples (e.g. Sampson et al. 2008).
#'
#' If \eqn{R_b}{Rb} varies slowly, i.e. with some low frequency then the 'scale dependent parameter estimation, SCAPE'
#' allows us to identify this oscillatory pattern. As a consequence, the estimation of \eqn{E_a}{Ea} can be substantially stabilized (Mahecha et al. 2010). The model becomes
#'
#' \eqn{Resp(i) = R_b(i) e^{\frac{1}{Tref-T0} - \frac{1}{T(i)-T0}}}{Resp(i) = Rb(i) * exp(1/(Tref-T0) - 1/(T(i)-T0))},
#'
#' where \eqn{R_b(i)}{Rb(i)} is the time varying 'basal respiration', i.e. the respiration expected at \eqn{Tref}{Tref}. The convenience function gettau allows to extract the \eqn{E_a}{Ea} value minimizing the confounding factor of the time varying \eqn{R_b}{Rb}. Four different spectral methods can be used and compared. A surrogate technique (function by curtsey of Dr. Henning Rust, written in the context of Venema et al. 2006) is applied to propagate the uncertainty due to the decomposition.

#' The user is strongly encouraged to use the function with caution, i.e. see critique by Graf et al. (2011).
