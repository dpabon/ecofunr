Description: A package to derive Ecosystem Functional properties (EFPs) using the
    exchange of energy and matter registered by eddy covariance towers, specifically by FLUXNET
    database (https://fluxnet.fluxdata.org).
    The package also provide different algorithms to extract eco-physiophenological metrics as
    the timing of the maximum photosynthetic rate (GPPmax) or the beggining and the end of the growing
    season.
    This package provide a flexible framework to derive EFPs at different temporal scales 
    using different aggregation metrics. In future the package will include different algorithms to derive EFPs
    using remote sensing information.
    For more information about EFPs please see: https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1216065111
