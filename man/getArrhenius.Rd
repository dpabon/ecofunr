\description{
Function to determine the temperature sensitivity for an Arrhenius-like model and time varying
basal efflux (\eqn{R_b(i)}{Rb(i)}) from a given temperature and efflux (usually respiration) time series
according the principle of 'SCAle dependent Parameter Estimation, SCAPE' (Mahecha et al. 2010).

\details{
Function to determine the temperature sensitivity (\eqn{E_a}{Ea} value) and time varying basal efflux (\eqn{R_b}{Rb}) from a given temperature and efflux (usually respiration) time series.
The following Arrhenius model could be used to describe the respiration:

 \eqn{Resp(i) = R_b e^\frac{- Ea}{R T(i)} }{Resp(i) = R_b * exp(- Ea / (R T(i)))},

where \eqn{i}{i} is the time index. It has been shown, however, that this model is misleading when \eqn{R_b}{Rb} is varying over time which can be expected in many real world examples (e.g. Sampson et al. 2008).

If \eqn{R_b}{Rb} varies slowly, i.e. with some low frequency then the 'scale dependent parameter estimation, SCAPE'
allows us to identify this oscillatory pattern. As a consequence, the estimation of \eqn{E_a}{Ea} can be substantially stabilized (Mahecha et al. 2010). The model becomes

\eqn{Resp(i) = R_b(i) e^\frac{- Ea}{R T(i)} }{Resp(i) = R_b(i) * exp(- Ea / (R T(i)))},

where \eqn{R_b(i)}{Rb(i)} is the time varying 'basal respiration', i.e. the respiration expected at \eqn{Tref}{Tref}. The convenience function getArrhenius allows to extract the \eqn{E_a}{Ea} value minimizing the confounding factor of the time varying \eqn{R_b}{Rb}. Four different spectral methods can be used and compared. A surrogate technique (function by curtsey of Dr. Henning Rust, written in the context of Venema et al. 2006) is applied to propagate the uncertainty due to the decomposition.

The user is strongly encouraged to use the function with caution, i.e. see critique by Graf et al. (2011).
