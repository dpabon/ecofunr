# ecofunr

A framework to derive **Eco**system **Fun**ctional Properties including Physio-Phenological events using [FLUXNET](https://fluxnet.fluxdata.org/) database.

## Installation

You can install the released version of ecofunr from [github](https://github.com/dpabon/ecofunr) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("dpabon/ecofunr")
```

## Loading

```r
library(ecofunr)
```

## Developing Schedule

* **08-2019** Version: 0.0.0.90000. Functions to derive EFPs at local scale using FLUXNET database)
* **09-2019** Version: 0.1.0. Functions to derive physio-phenological metrics e.g. Time of the maximum photosyntetic rate, beggining and end of the growing season)
* **03-2020** Version: 0.2.0. Functions to derive EFPs (including physiophenological metrics) using remote sensing information (Sentinel-2)
